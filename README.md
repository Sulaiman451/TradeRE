# Overview
This is a real estate homepage which includes a landing page, a "How It Works" section, a "Properties" section which uses a carousel slider (Slick | jQuery plugin), a list of agents (with photos of them), marketing materials, a "Services" section, a testimonials carousel, a contact form, and a footer. Fully responsive design has been implemented.

This is a portfolio-worthy project as I believe it exemplifies the fundamentals of Web Development: HTML for the content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
