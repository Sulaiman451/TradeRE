# Overview
This is a real estate homepage which includes a landing page, a "How It Works" section, a "Properties" section which uses a carousel slider (Slick | jQuery plugin), a list of agents (with photos of them), marketing materials, a "Services" section, a testimonials carousel, a contact form, and a footer. Fully responsive design has been implemented with CSS media queries. The JavaScript code is embedded within index.html as there is not a great deal of JavaScript in this project. It is there for handling the carousels alongside click events. 

The idea behind this is to demonstrate competency with the fundamentals of Web Development. The HTML code provides the content, the CSS combined with extras such as Google Fonts provide the crisp design, and the JavaScript allows basic functionality. This certainly is not the most advanced JavaScript ever seen, though some of my other repositories emphasise JavaScript far more.
